## What is this

This repository contains data and analyses reported in the paper ..
Since some files are large, some users experienced issues trying to download data from the repository due to the quota policy used by github. To overcome such issue, a compressed version of the repository has been archived on FigShare (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Integration_of_single-cell_datasets_reveals_novel_transcriptomic_signatures_of_-cells_in_human_type_2_diabetes_/19754566).
